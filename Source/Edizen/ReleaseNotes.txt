1.2.1 [2014-11-01]:
%) Text editor won't jump around when selecting items from intellisense.

1.2.0 [2014-10-26]:
+) Introduced the 'Bottom Split Fraction' so that a view port segment can be specified. Auto scrolling will only 
be done when the cursor moves outside of that segment. E.g. to have a top and bottom margin of 25% of the editor 
view height you need to set 'Split Fraction' to 0.25 and 'Bottom Split Fraction' to 0.75. Setting the 'Bottom
Split Fraction' to a negative value well keep the cursor exactly at the 'Split Fraction' position (old behavior).
%) Fixed an issue that caused disable auto sync to not work correctly, when text was selected in the editor.

1.1.0 [2014-10-18]:
+) AutoSync will be temporarily disabled while mouse buttons are pressed to stop the editor from moving around 
when clicking or selecting text.
