Little extension that helps to keep the cursor at a specified vertical positon. This can be
helpful when you try to keep your hands on the primary keyboard pane as much as possible
as you don't need to reach the Page keys or the scroll wheel to move the editor viewport.

By default the extension will keep the cursor at the center of the screen. You can
change this setting in the options page of Visual Studio.

The extension will always keep the cursor at the desired position. You can disable
this 'autosync' behavior by invoking Edit -> Enable Edizen Autosync or hitting
the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + F11\. Then you have to invoke
'Edit -> Sync Edizen' manually. Note this command doesn't have any
keyboard shortcut by default. But you can assign shortcuts to both commands
in Visual Studio's keyboard settings.

**1.2.0 [2014-10-26]:** +) Introduced the 'Bottom Split Fraction' so that a view port segment can be specified. Auto scrolling will only   be done when the cursor moves outside of that segment.

Setting the 'Bottom     Split Fraction' to a negative value (default) will keep the cursor exactly at the 'Split Fraction' position (old behavior).
